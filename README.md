# React Router v6 Nested Routes Bug

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered when using nested routes in React Router v6.  The issue involves nested routes failing to render correctly under specific conditions.  The `App.js` file shows the buggy implementation, while `AppSolution.js` provides a corrected version.

## Bug Description

Nested routes in React Router v6 are unexpectedly not rendering.  The problem seems linked to the specific structure of the routes and is not consistently reproducible across all nested route configurations.

## Solution

The solution involves reviewing the route structure and potentially making adjustments to the route path definitions.  The exact solution will depend on the specific nature of the routes and their nesting. The `AppSolution.js` file provides an example of how the issue can be resolved, but the exact correction needed will vary depending on the specific problem.
